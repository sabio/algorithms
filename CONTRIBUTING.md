# What to contribute?

Write any algorithm, data structure demo or general application in the programming language of your choice, and open a
pull request. Your request will be assigned to one of the maintainers and reviewed as soon as possible.

# Are there any rules?

### 1. Make sure to put your code in an appropriate directory

```
├── problem category (or sub-category)
│   ├── programming language
│   │   └── your code!
```

If you don't find a proper location, feel free to create it!

### 2. Make sure to that the code you're adding is of your own creation

If you think this goes without saying, then rest assured that this message is not for you; you most likely already abide
by this rule.

[The Hacktoberfest message is strong](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/details#quality-standards), and we want to
be in tune with their values. For that however, we maintainers have to be strict when dealing with spam, which is
plenty, unfortunately. So here's how it goes:

- **Spam PRs or PRs containing blatant copies of snippets from the web will be immediately tagged `invalid` and
closed.** We use up our free time to read, review and engage in every pull request made to this repository, and any time
we waste with spam is lost by not properly engaging with developers who actually want to contribute to the event in a
constructive manner.

- **If you think your PR was wrongfully taken down, post a comment on your PR clarifying the issue, or just send a mail
to any of the maintainers (addresses on their respective profiles).** Given the situation described above, it's totally
possible that we end up closing your request by mistake, and we apologize for it. We'll try our best not to though, and
if it does happen, rest assured that we'll respond to any inquiries as fast as possible.

Again, We're very sorry if any of this was not for your ears. We hope you understand our need to state all this.

If you're reading this, we really do hope you make a contribution here. Happy hacking! :smile:

# A note on stale requests

If your pull request has been inactive for too long after a review with requested changes, as in without any follow-ups,
we might end up tagging your request as `stale` and closing it. The conversation will be left open though, and if by
any chance you'd like to follow up on the old PR, just tag any of the maintainers (preferably one of the assignees)
in a comment and we'll re-open and re-review the contribution.
